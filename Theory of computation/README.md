## Finite State Automata, Regular Expressions and Regular Languages
### Finite State Automata
> Finite automata are machines which accept or reject string


### Regular Expressions
- **alphabet Σ:** any finite set of symbols ``(eg. {0,1}, {a,b,c}``
- **string s**: over Σ is a finite sequence of symbols in Σ ``(eg. an example of s over Σ = {0,1} is 0100101)``
- **length #:** number of symbols it contains ``(eg. #(0100) = 4)``
- **empty string ∈:** is a string s where #(s) = 0
