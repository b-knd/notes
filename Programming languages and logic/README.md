## Types of programming languages
1. **Procedural programming languages**
    
    > _Main structure is having sequence of statements and commands in order to achieve a final desired output_
    > 
    > ex: C, C++, [Java](/Programming%20languages%20and%20logic/Java), Pascal, BASIC

2. **Functional programming languages**
    
    > _Focus on the application of functions to arguments. Each function performs specific tasks and return results based on input._ 
    >
    > ex: [Haskell](/Programming%20languages%20and%20logic/Haskell), Scala, Erlang, Elixir, F#

3. **Object-oriented programming languages**

    > _Treates program as group of objects composed by data and program elements known as attributes and methods. Objects can be reused within program or other programs_
    > 
    > ex: [Java], Python, PHP, C++, Ruby
4. **Scripted languages**

5. **Logic programming languages**
