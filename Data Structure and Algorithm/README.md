# Data Structure and Algorithm
**Linear Data Structure**
> Data structure which the data elements are placed sequentially or linearly

- Static (fixed memory size)
  - Array

- Dynamic (size not fixed, support update of data)
  - Array List
  - Linked List

**Non-Linear Data Structure**
> Data structure which the data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly thus cannot be traversed in single run
- [Graph](#graph)

## Graph
A data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (lines/arcs) connecting two nodes in the graph. 
> Formally denoted as G(E, V) which represents a graph G with set of vertices V and edges E.
- **Vertices:** vertex or nodes, labeled or unlabelled
- **Edges:** lines or arcs connecting two nodes, labeled or unlabelled, directed or undirected

```ðŸ’¡ Real life usage**

Used to represent networks, eg. paths in city, telephone, circuit or social network```
