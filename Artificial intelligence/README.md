## Introduction to AI
> **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
>
> **Intelligence**: ability to acquire, understand and apply knowledge to achieve goals in the world

### Knowledge-Based AI vs Learning-Based AI
**Knowledge-Based AI**
- Uses deductive reasoning
- From a general statement, examine available possiblities to reach a conclusion

**Learning-Based AI**
- Uses inductive reasoning
- Extract a likely premise from specific and limited observation
- Learning from data to figure out pattern and trend

### AI Topology
> From two dimensions - human vs. rational and thought vs. behaviour we can derive four possible combination (Thinking humanly, acting humanly, thinking rationally and acting rationally)

**Acting Humanly: Turing test approach**
- To pass a test, a maching has to act in a way such that a human interrogator is unable to distinguish between the machine and another human respondant
- Criteria in passing Turing Test: 
  - Natural language processing: to communicate effectively in human language
  - Knowledge representation: to store what it knows or hears
  - Automated reasoning: to answer question and derive new conclusions
  - Machine learning: to learn from past experience, detecting and extrapolating patterns to adapt to new circumstances
- To pass a total Turing Test (interacting with human and the real world), computer visions and robotics are needed

**Thinking Humanly: Cognitive approach**
- To understand how human think, some of the approaches are introspection, pshychological experiments and brain imaging
- Application of cognitive science to construct precise and testable theories of human mind

**Thinking Rationally: The "law of thought" process**
- Logic: to yield a correct conclusions given a correct premises

**Acting Rationally: Rational agent approach**
- Rational agent to act in order to achieve the best (expected) outcomes
- Skills needed in turing test are also applicable here
